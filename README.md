What is this?
================================================================================
This branch `with-fof-3-extended` of `com_todo` is an extended version of the Akeeba branch [with-fof-3] (https://github.com/akeeba/todo-fof-example/tree/with-fof-3)

The extended aspects are features of FOF3 in simple (hopefully well) annoted examples.

See the [ROADMAP] (https://github.com/willfaulds/todo-fof-example/blob/with-fof-3-extended/ROADMAP.md)
